## Qdrant is a vector database designed with a focus on performance, efficiency, and affordability. 

Here are some key points and takeaways:

1. Performance Focus: Qdrant emphasizes performance as its top priority, aiming to provide fast and accurate results while minimizing cloud costs. Various optimizations, such as using Rust, IO optimizations, serverless support, binary quantization, and the fastembed library, are implemented to achieve this goal.

2. Benchmarking Approach: Qdrant conducts comparative benchmarks against other vector search engines. These benchmarks are designed to provide relative comparisons rather than absolute numbers and are performed using affordable hardware to ensure reproducibility. Benchmarks are open-sourced, allowing contributions and improvements from the community.

3. Tested Scenarios: Qdrant conducts benchmarks in various scenarios, including single-node benchmarks with different configurations and datasets. Benchmarks measure metrics such as Requests-per-Second (RPS), latency, p95 latency, and index time.

4. Observations: Qdrant consistently achieves high RPS and low latencies across different scenarios compared to other engines. Elasticsearch shows considerable speed improvements but suffers from slow indexing times. Milvus excels in indexing time but may lag in RPS and latency for higher-dimensional embeddings or larger datasets.

5. Hardware and Setup: Benchmarks are conducted using standardized hardware configurations for both client and server machines. The engines are run in Docker containers with memory limitations to ensure fairness.

6. Filtered Search Benchmark: Qdrant also conducts filtered search benchmarks to evaluate engine performance when applying filters to search results. Qdrant aims to avoid common problems like speed downturns and accuracy collapse encountered by other engines.

7. Transparency and Open Source: Qdrant's benchmarks and source code are open-sourced, promoting transparency and community contributions. The company encourages users to reproduce benchmarks and contribute to improving them.

8. Community Engagement: Qdrant maintains communication channels like GitHub, Discord, Twitter, and newsletters for community engagement, updates, and support.

Overall, Qdrant positions itself as a high-performance, cost-effective solution for vector similarity search tasks, with a focus on transparency, community involvement, and continuous improvement.
